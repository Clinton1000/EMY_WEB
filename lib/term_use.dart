    <p style="margin-bottom:14pt; background-color:#ffffff;"><strong><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#1a1b1f;">6.1. In General.</span></strong><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#1a1b1f;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#1a1b1f;">If you have sufficiently verified your identity, your Digital Currency Wallet enables you to send Supported Digital Currency to, and request, receive, and store Supported Digital Currency from, third parties by giving instructions through the Changecollect Site. Your transfer of Supported Digital Currencies between your other digital currency wallets (including wallets off the Changecollect Site) and to and from third parties is a &ldquo;Digital Currency Transfer&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:14pt; background-color:#ffffff;"><strong><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#1a1b1f;">6.2. Pending Transactions.</span></strong><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#1a1b1f;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#1a1b1f;">Once a Digital Currency Transfer is submitted to a Digital Currency network, the transaction will be unconfirmed and remain in a pending state for a period of time sufficient to confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Currency network. A Digital Currency Transfer is not complete while it is in a pending state. Pending Digital Currency Transfers that are initiated from a Changecollect Account will reflect a pending transaction status and are not available to you for use on the Changecollect platform or otherwise while the transaction is pending.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:14pt; background-color:#ffffff;"><strong><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#1a1b1f;">6.3. Inbound Digital Currency Transfers.</span></strong><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#1a1b1f;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#1a1b1f;">When you or a third party sends Digital Currency to a Changecollect wallet from an external wallet not hosted on Changecollect (&ldquo;Inbound Transfers&rdquo;), the person initiating the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which may include, among other things, payment of sufficient network or miner&rsquo;s fees in order for the transaction to be successful. Insufficient network fees may cause an Inbound Transfer to remain in a pending state outside of Changecollect&rsquo;s control and we are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions. By initiating an Inbound Transfer, you attest that you are transacting in a Supported Digital Currency which conforms to the particular Changecollect wallet into which funds are directed. For example, if you select an Ethereum wallet address to receive funds, you attest that you are initiating an Inbound Transfer of Ethereum alone, and not any other currency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum Classic. Changecollect incurs no obligation whatsoever with regard to unsupported digital currency sent to a Changecollect Account or Supported Digital Currency sent to an incompatible Digital Currency wallet. Erroneously transmitted funds will be lost, and we take no responsibility for it. We recommend customers send a small amount of Supported Digital Currency as a test prior to initiating a send of a significant amount of Supported Digital Currency. Changecollect may from time to time determine types of Digital Currency that will be supported or cease to be supported.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:14pt; background-color:#ffffff;"><strong><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#1a1b1f;">6.4.

You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to us. Changecollect shall bear no liability or responsibility in the event you enter an incorrect blockchain destination address. We do not guarantee the identity or value received by a recipient of an Outbound Transfer. Digital Currency Transfers cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant Digital Currency network, although they may be in a pending state, and designated accordingly, while the transaction is processed by network operators. Changecollect does not control the Digital Currency network and makes no guarantees that a Digital Currency Transfer will be confirmed by the network. We may refuse to process or cancel any pending Outbound Digital Currency Transfers as required by law or any court or other authority to which Changecollect is subject in any jurisdiction. Additionally, we may require you to wait some amount of time after completion of a transaction before permitting you to use further Changecollect Services and/or before permitting you to engage in transactions beyond certain volume limits.</span></p>

Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your local small claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis. Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association&apos;s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible at</span><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#1a1b1f;">&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf)" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#13c2c2;">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf)</span></a><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#1a1b1f;">.</span></p>

THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&apos;S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CHANGECOLLECT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:14pt; background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-family:'SpaceGrotesk'; color:#1a1b1f;">The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county or parish in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. An arbitrator&rsquo;s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. To the extent permitted by law, the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement, any arbitration pursuant to this Agreement, or any small claims action shall be entitled to costs and attorneys&apos; fees. If the arbitrator or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator&apos;s rules or applicable law.</span></p>
